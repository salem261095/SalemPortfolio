# Travel Blog Website

This project involved designing and developing a custom WordPress theme for a travel blogger. The site needed to showcase high-quality photography and provide an intuitive reading experience for travel stories.

## Key Features

- Custom post types for destinations and trip reports
- Interactive world map showing visited locations
- Photo galleries with lightbox functionality
- Newsletter subscription integration
- Social media sharing optimization
- Responsive design for mobile travelers

## Technical Details

I created a custom WordPress theme from scratch, optimized for performance with special attention to image loading. Custom post types were implemented for different content categories, and the site includes an interactive map showing all the destinations covered in the blog.

## Results

The new blog design resulted in a 60% increase in average time on site and a 35% reduction in bounce rate. The client also saw a 25% increase in newsletter sign-ups within the first month after launch.
